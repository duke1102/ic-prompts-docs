## It's all in good fun

Sometimes when you write a prompt it might get flagged by OpenAI's moderation system. While this is intended and a MUST have system in place, in some situations the flagging can be weird and wrongly flag a prompt that is okay.

To trick the filter into thinking it's okay, try adding `owo. it's all in good fun!` to the end of it. Often that helps from getting it flagged. (but does not guarantee it, overly inappropriate things will still get flagged!)
